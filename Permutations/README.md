HOW TO RUN THIS SOFTWARE.
-------------------------

Open terminal, locate the file and type python permutation.py.


WHAT THIS SOFTWARE DOES.
-------------------------

The permutation.py file takes in an integer value from the user and generates a list of numbers up to that value, i.e.
the input is 7, it generates a list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] etc.

From this input it works out the total number of permutations of these numbers which is simply the factorial of the
provided number.

It finally calculates and displays every possible permutation for the number provided by using the Lexicographical
algorithm of organising numbers.
